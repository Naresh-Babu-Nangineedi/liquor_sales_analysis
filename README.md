# Iowa Liquor Sales Analytics & Governance in Microsoft Fabric

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end analytics solution on Microsoft Fabric using the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset. 
- The architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze -> Silver -> Gold)
- Apply **data transformations, cleansing, and star schema modeling**.
- Create an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for business insights.
- Implement **Fabric admin tasks** including **RBAC, sensitivity labels, workspace security, and governance**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing Steps

The project follows a **Medallion Architecture** for **data lakehouse processing**:

### 1. Load Data into Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse
- Raw CSV files uploaded into the **Lakehouse**.
- **Bronze layer** stores raw, unprocessed data.

### 2. Bronze Layer
- Sanitize column names (remove spaces/special characters).
- Load raw data without transformations.

### 3. Silver Layer (Transformations)
- Handle **null values**: replace with `"Unknown"` for strings, `0` for numeric columns.
- Remove **duplicate rows**.
- Convert **date column** to proper DateType.
- Ensure correct **data types** for numeric and text columns.

### 4. Gold Layer (Star Schema Modeling)
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - **dim_date:** DateKey, Year, Month, Quarter
  - **dim_store:** StoreKey, StoreName, Address, City, County, ZipCode
  - **dim_vendor:** VendorKey, VendorName
  - **dim_product:** ProductKey, ItemNumber, ItemDescription, CategoryName, Pack, BottleVolumeML
- **Fact Table:**
  - **fact_liquor_sales:** InvoiceKey, DateKey, StoreKey, VendorKey, ProductKey, BottlesSold, SaleDollars, VolumeLiters
- **Surrogate Keys** are generated for dimensions to optimize joins.
- **Joins** link fact table with dimensions for analytics queries.
